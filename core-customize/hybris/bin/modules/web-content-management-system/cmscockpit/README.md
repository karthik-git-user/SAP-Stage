CmsCockpit CEP (Cloud Extension Pack) Extension

This extension is the old cmscockpit from 1808 (that was removed in 1811) and adapted to run with Java 11 and Spring 5.
It provides only the WCMS cockpit application, without any support for LiveEdit, Multi-Country WCMS cockpit, or BTG cockpit.

It is planned to remove all support for cockpit (core) in 2005. Therefore, this extension should not be maintained after 1905.
